### Project Proposal: **Parallel K-Means Clustering Algorithm Using CUDA**

For our high-performance computing project, we have chosen to work on the **K-Means Clustering Algorithm** using CUDA to learn about parallel computing on the GPU. K-Means is a common algorithm in machine learning that is used to group data points into clusters based on how similar they are. It is useful because it can help find patterns in data without needing labels.

#### Why K-Means?

K-means is a simple but powerful algorithm that groups data points based on how close they are to cluster centers, called centroids. However, this process can take a lot of time, especially with large datasets. This is why it makes sense to make it faster by running parts of it in parallel on a GPU.

#### Goals

- Implement both the **assignment step** (where each point is assigned to the closest centroid) and **update step** (where we recalculate the centroids) in parallel using CUDA.
- Use **shared memory**, **memory coalescing**, and **synchronization** to make the algorithm faster.
- Compare the performance of our parallel version with a traditional CPU-based version of K-Means.

#### Expected Challenges

We expect some challenges, like figuring out how to access memory efficiently, using **reduction operations** to update centroids, managing **thread synchronization**, and using **shared memory** well to make the algorithm faster. These challenges will help us understand CUDA better and learn how to make parallel algorithms more efficient.

#### Conclusion

This project will give us practical experience using high-performance computing techniques on a well-known machine learning algorithm. K-means clustering is simple to understand, but it still requires a lot of computing power, which makes it a good choice for learning how to optimize algorithms on a GPU. We are excited to see how much faster we can make it using GPU acceleration.
